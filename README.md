## GitHub Profile Viewer

A small project made for the sake of learning about API handling and JavaScript, this site lets you view GitHub profiles in detail using the GitHub API.

### Features
- [ ] Search by GitHub username
- [ ] Detailed profile view (avatar, bio, stats, repos)
- [ ] Loading and empty states
- [ ] Data fetching from the GitHub API
- [ ] Link to the user's profile
- [ ] Light/Dark mode

Because of the GitHub API's rate limit, you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour.
